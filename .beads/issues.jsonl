Create client with TLS config\n2. Load CA certificate\n3. Connect to Hatchet with TLS\n4. Verify encrypted communication\n\n### Happy Path (mTLS)\n1. Create client with mTLS config\n2. Load client cert and key\n3. Connect with mutual authentication\n4. Verify both sides authenticated\n\n### Validation\n- Test TLS connection to secure Hatchet\n- Test mTLS with client certificates\n- Test insecure mode works for local dev\n- Verify certificate validation errors\n\n### Implementation Reference\nPython: /tmp/hatchet-python/hatchet_sdk/loader.py (tls_config)\nGo: /tmp/hatchet/pkg/client/client.go (TLS options)\n\n### Files to Modify\n- src/hatchet/client.gleam - Add TLS options\n- src/hatchet/types.gleam - TLSConfig type\n\n### Definition of Done\n- [ ] TLSConfig type defined\n- [ ] with_tls() client option\n- [ ] with_mtls() client option  \n- [ ] with_insecure() for local dev\n- [ ] Certificate loading works\n- [ ] Integration test with TLS Hatchet","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"priorlewis43@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-26T13:21:11.080596219-06:00","created_by":"Lewis Prior","updated_at":"2026-01-26T13:29:55.302127583-06:00"}
